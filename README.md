# Galactic
Galactic is a prototype level that I developed to experiment with dynamic APIs and C++ in Unreal Engine. Using custom shaders, I implemented a moving fog texture and the ability to displace UVs in real time. By shooting shader targeted objects, the player can activate its shader in-game and then use button presses to blend the color of the shader. The game level renders 2D and 3D procedural mesh components on startup and a 3D runtime mesh component.
